# Project 1
## The Number Guessing Game

In this project you will build a console game that will let you exercise the skills and concepts you have learned in the unit so far. This game is often called the Number Guessing Game or the Pick A Number game.

Have you ever played a game with your friends where you ask them to pick a number between some range of numbers like: "Pick a number between 1 and 10". Their job is to make a guess, and you tell them whether their guess is too high or too low. Their next guess is based on what you've told them. If they guess the right answer the game is done. Normally you try to do this in the lowest number of tries possible. Often it is used to compete with friends to see who can get the answer in the lowest number of guesses.

# Project Instructions
*To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question on Slack or in the Treehouse Community.*

1. Make sure your script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.
For example, non-number guesses should be handled with an exception.
2. As a player of the game, I should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message.
3. A random number should be chosen that is within the range.
4. As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.
5. As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that I can narrow down my guesses.
6. As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown my number of attempts at guessing.
7. When the game ends, an ending message is shown to the player.
8. As a player of the game, my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the guessing range I should be told to try again.
For example, if the range is 1-10 and the player enters 12 they should be informed that this number is outside the range.
9. As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.
10. As a player of the game, at the start of each game I should be shown the current high score (least amount of points) so that I know what I am supposed to beat.
11. Every time a player decides to play again, the random number to guess is updated so players are guessing something new each time.
